## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build or run `npm run build:prod`.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). Run `npm run test:ci` to run the same tests in a continuous integration environment.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). Run `npm run e2e:ci` to run the same tests in a continuous integration environment.

Run `npm run cy:open` to open the interactive Cypress dashboard or `npm run cy:run` to run the end-to-end tests. For these two commands to work the application must me started with `npm run start` before the tests can work.
